# [Plait](https://plait.js.org/)

Plait is a minimal JavaScript framework for building isomorphic reactive web components. It is loosely based on <a href="https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/">The Elm Architecture</a> and Elm's <a href="https://github.com/evancz/start-app"><code>StartApp</code></a>.

## The Basic Idea

Inspired by the experience of writing reactive applications in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), Plait is an attempt at achieving a similar application architecture with a minimal amount of JavaScript.

In Plait, an application is composed of one or more encapsulated components. A component is made up of 3 functions: `init`, which provides the component's initial state; `view`, which renders the component at a given state and attaches actions to the UI elements; and `update`, which modifies the component's state based on actions dispatched from the UI.

Component state is implemented as an immutable map. Behind the scenes, the state is contained & managed by [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux). A component's `update` function is just a Redux [reducer](http://rackt.org/redux/docs/basics/Reducers.html).

Component views are written in [virtual-hyperscript](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom/blob/master/virtual-hyperscript/README.md) and rendered by [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom). DOM events are transparently handled by [dom-delegator](https://github.com/Raynos/dom-delegator).

With minimal effort, component views can be written in JSX and compiled to virtual-hyperscript using [jsx-transform](https://github.com/alexmingoia/jsx-transform).

## An Example Application

The following is an example of an application composed of a single counter component. [View the demo](https://plait.js.org/examples/Counter.html)

> _Note: For more complex example applications, see [the Plait documentation](https://plait.js.org/examples/index.html)._

```jsx
import h from 'virtual-dom/h'
import Plait from 'plait'

const app = Plait.start({ init, update, view })

Plait.render(document.getElementById('app'), app)

function init () {
  return {
    count: 0
  }
}

function update (state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state.update('count', x => x - 1)

    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state.update('count', x => x + 1)
  }
}

function view (state, dispatch) {
  return (
    <div>
      <button ev-click={dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}>-</button>
      <span>{state.get('count')}</span>
      <button ev-click={dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>+</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Plait is Fast

Plait is extremely fast compared to other popular JavaScript frameworks. Like [Mercury](https://github.com/Raynos/mercury) and [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), this is in large part due to the use of [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) as well as a focus on **immutability** and **purity**.

Using the [TodoMVC app](https://plait.js.org/examples/TodoMVC.html) as a benchmark, Plait performs better than Elm and almost as well as Mercury. You can [run the benchmark](https://wildlyinaccurate.com/todomvc-perf-comparison/) yourself to see.
